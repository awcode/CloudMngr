Cloud Mngr
==============

**A control panel system for building and controlling your cloud hosted infrastructure**

Currently this is being built for Amazon Web services but will also be supporting Google Cloud Compute soon.

The goal is a simple to use interface that anyone can use to build a load balancing, self scaling, enterprise grade hosting infrastucture without needing to be a linux guru.
Preset configs out of the box to get anyone started in minutes, plus the modular and configuration options for sys-ops to take things to even higher levels.

- version 0.0.1 - rough, raw and incomplete - not yet production ready!
